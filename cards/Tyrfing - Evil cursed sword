Flavor text:
"May your sword, Svafrlami, be a man's bane each time it is drawn
 and may three vile deeds be done with that sword. It will also be death to your kin."


Origin:
In Hlöðskviða, a cursed sword that was fashioned by the dwarfs. 
It would cut through anything as if through cloth, would neither break nor rust, would always bring victory, but would also always kill a man each time it was unsheathed.

According to the 13th-century Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks, the sword was made by Dvalinn and Durinn for king Svafrlami, the son of Sigrlami, the son of Odin. 


The dwarves made the sword, and it shone and gleamed like fire. However, in revenge they cursed it so that it would kill a man every time it was drawn and that it would be the cause of three great evils. 
They finally cursed it so that it would also kill Svafrlami himself.
